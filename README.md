## Inspiration
My brother and I are big fans of Blackjack. However, we noticed that a lot of players at a casino do not know when they should hit/stay and often play based off their "gut feeling" which decreases their odds of winning. By playing by the "book" and always making moves based off math, you are much more likely to win in the long run. By seeing the odds of the dealer/user busting for each hand, with practice, users will know when they should hit/stay and be more successful when they play Blackjack.
